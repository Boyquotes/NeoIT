# NeoIT
A Godot port of the open source game Impressive Title.


## History
This game is a port of an animal MMORPG called Impressive Title. Impressive Title was
created by a talented game designer known as KovuLKD. The original source code for
Impressive Title was made open source shortly after Kov released a new game called
Feral Heart. Feral Heart is known as the sequel to Impressive Title and is still in
operation as of the last date this file was updated. You can find Feral Heart
![here](https://feral-heart.com)

I started this port of Impressive Title to improve upon the original game, to make 
the game easier for people to build new Impressive Title games, and remove some of 
the weird bugs that have always plagued the original game. I also seek to preserve 
this game for future generations by ensuring that it will run on newer PCs and even 
mobile devices.

For historical purposes, you can find a copy of the original game (with some 
improvements) ![here](https://github.com/Cybermals/RetroIT)
